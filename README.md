# Blender Blunders
This repository consists of a few blender files, all of which were made using a trackpad, while sleep deprived and on 4 cans of Mountain Dew.

Specific issues are highlighted here, to make the next unlucky soul's visit here easier:

- BB_Table has a missing leg. You can additionally spice up the tabletop by adding some coffee for the artist (in a mug preferably).
- 

### Requirements to run:
- [Blender](https://www.blender.org/download/)
- [Mouse](https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/800/800/jfoac280/mouse/w/s/2/disney-mickey-mouse-wired-pc-laptop-computer-original-imaf4fvyrteuc2pp.jpeg?q=90)

### Things to note

- All files included are .blend files. In case you want to import external models, use .fbx or .obj only.
- By default the files have their render settings set at 100 samples in Cycles.
- Make sure to test renders on the Eevee render engine, if you do not have a dedicated Graphics card.
- Remember to save your files!
